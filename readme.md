# PHP Helpers 

Depedency free, framework agnostic helpers.

## Framework Agnostic?

I think that's a saying, right?  The goal of this project is to reduce pain when maintaining existing codebases.  Think of this as a Quality of Life improvement.  Nothing bloated, just a small library to enforce better habits.

## Totally a Work in Progress.

I'm just building out things that would've been helpful on past maintenance contracts, or things that will be helpful in the future. As I come across new things, new functionality will be added.

## Composer 

No idea if this is a functional composer package yet.  It will be.

## Examples 

Examples will be found in the root of this repo until I get proper documentation put together
